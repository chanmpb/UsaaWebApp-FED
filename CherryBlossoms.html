<h4>Cherry Blossoms</h4>
A cherry blossom (or commonly known in Japan as sakura) is the flower of any of several trees of genus Prunus, particularly the Japanese cherry, Prunus serrulata (桜 or 櫻; さくら).
Currently it is widely distributed, especially in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere including Japan, Taiwan, Korea, China, West Siberia, Iran, Pakistan, India, Canada, and the United States. Along with the chrysanthemum, the cherry blossom is considered the national flower of Japan.
Many of the varieties that have been cultivated for ornamental use do not produce fruit. Edible cherries generally come from cultivars of the related species Prunus avium and Prunus cerasus. Cherry blossom are also closely related to other Prunus trees such as the almond, peach, plum and apricot, and more distantly to apples, pears and roses.
